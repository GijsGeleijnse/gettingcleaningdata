## Codebook for my_tidy_summary_table
## the my_tidy_table.txt provides the table as
## computed in the first four steps of the assignment



# the table starts with the number of the subject [1:30]
# and the name of the activity conducted that reflects the 
# measurements in the row

"1" "subject"
"2" "activity"

# the subsequent measurements are reflecting the mean and standard deviations as 
# obtained through the Samsung device
# for these features, the MEAN over all subject-activity measurement combinations
# is provided
